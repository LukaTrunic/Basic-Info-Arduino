# ðŸ”§ ðŸ“Ÿ Arduino-Based Environmental Monitoring System (Distance, Temperature, Light)

This project is a microcontroller-based implementation for a basic simulation or demonstration of a radiation detection or monitoring concept, developed as a final assignment.



## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Arduino (written in C++)
- Basic I/O components (based on project setup image)
- Serial communication for debugging/output


## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Open `final.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the appropriate Arduino board (e.g., Uno or Nano).
3. Use Serial Monitor to observe output and verify behavior.
4. Refer to `image.jpg` for wiring or setup reference.
